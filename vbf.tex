\chapter{The Search for Invisible Decays of the Higgs Boson}
\label{sec:vbf}

The discovery of the SM Higgs boson~\needcite~involved multiple production modes.
Gluon fusion has the largest cross section (49 pb) at the LHC because of the large gluon PDF, followed by vector boson fusion (VBF) (3.8 pb), $WH$ (1.4 pb), and $ZH$ (0.89 pb)~\cite{lhchxswg}.
While gluon fusion is the most frequent mode, the unique detector signatures of the other production modes can be combined the various Higgs decay signatures to define a signal topology with few backgrounds.

Many DM models~\needcite~allow for DM fermions or scalars to acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, coupling to the SM Higgs boson.
If the DM candidate $\chi$ satisfies $2m_\chi < m_H$, then we expect to observe $H\rightarrow\chi\bar\chi$.
From measurements of the visible branching fractions, we can indirectly place an upper bound of $\mathcal{B}(H\rightarrow\chi\bar\chi)<0.2$~\needcite.
In this chapter, we describe a direct search for $H\rightarrow\chi\bar\chi$ decays.

As with the case of the mono-top search, the $H\rightarrow\chi\bar\chi$ process manifests as \ptmiss. 
Each of the aforementioned Higgs production modes translates into a $\ptmiss+X$ signature, where $X$ refers to one or more SM particles.
Figure~\ref{fig:vbf:hdiags} shows each of the signatures; in this chapter, we will focus on the VBF production mode, as the unique final state topology provides the best sensitivity to $H\rightarrow\chi\bar\chi$.

\section{Signal selection}

VBF $\hinv$ events are characterized by large $\ptmiss$ and two jets.
These jets are typically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fairly forward in the detector
    \item Far apart from each other in $\eta$
    \item Highly energetic (large $E$, moderate $\pt$)
    \item Close together in $\phi$
\end{itemize}
A candidate VBF $\hinv$ event displaying these properties is shown in a CMS event display in Figure~\ref{fig:vbf:ed}.

                 Green lines are tracks reconstructed from hits of charged particles in the tracker. 
                 The blue arrow represents the direction and magnitude of the $\ptmiss$.}

\subsection{Online trigger selection}

The same trigger decisions (L1 and HLT) as described in Section~\ref{sec:mt:trigger} are used to select events in this analysis.
However, the L1 seeds for the 2016 data run were designed with mono-top-like analyses in mind; i.e., searches where the momentum imbalance is created by central objects.
To avoid noise and resolution issues in the forward calorimeters, the L1 seed only considers energy deposits in the region ${|\eta|<3}$. 
Therefore, VBF events in which both jets are in the forward region are not selected.  

This is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:vbf:hlta}, where events are classified based on the location of the two highest-$\pt$ jets.
Events with both jets in the barrel (BB) have a higher efficiency than events with one jet in the forward detector (BF).
Note that events with two forward jets (FF) are not considered at all, as the efficiency for such events is essentially zero.

        \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.49\textwidth}

            \label{fig:vbf:hlta}

        \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.49\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/vbf/triggers/trigeff_nmu1barrelHTMiss.pdf}
            \caption{$H_\mathrm{T,barrel}^\mathrm{miss}$}
            \label{fig:vbf:hltb}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Trigger efficiency of events with a VBF-like topology (two jets with $\pt>80,40$ GeV) as a function of two different observables.
                 Events are split into two categories: those where both jets have $|\eta|<3$ (BB) and those were exactly one jet has $|\eta|>3$ (FF).
                 "All" refers to the sum of these categories.}
        \label{fig:vbf:hlt}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The trigger efficiency is truly characterized by the energy deposited in the $|\eta|<3$ region of the detector, and will be dominated in VBF events by the energy of jets.
Accordingly, we define the ``missing barrel hadronic transverse momentum'':
\begin{equation}
    H_\mathrm{T,barrel}^\mathrm{miss} = \left|\left(\sum_{j\in\text{barrel}} \vec{p}_j \right)_\mathrm{T}\right|, \text{ where barrel refers to jets with $|\eta|<3$}
\end{equation}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vbf:hltb}, the three categories (BB, BF, All) have similar behavior as a function of $H_\mathrm{T,barrel}^\mathrm{miss}$.
Therefore, we use this parameterization of the efficiency to correct MC simulation to match data. 

A second L1-related issue that plagues the 2016 dataset is caused by a ``pre-firing'' effect.
When an L1 seed is triggered to accept an event (``L1Accept'' or ``L1A''), the following two bunch crossings (not necessarily corresponding to collisions) are blocked from firing L1As. 
At most, two in four consecutive events can fire L1A (i.e. the sequence L1A, blocked, blocked, L1A).
A pre-fire refers to the case where a detector signal is mis-reconstructed, so that the peak of the pulse appears to have occurred in the previous event.   
In this particular case, a region of the ECAL ($2.5 < |\eta|<3$) suffered from a loss in transparency due to radiation damage and would produce pulse shapes that are poorly described by the model used to extract the pulse energy and time. 
When this happens, the L1 seeds for ECAL-based signatures (e.g. electron triggers) can fire an L1A, but for the event prior to which the signal came from.
So, we would have an L1A for an arbitrary event, and the interesting event would be blocked from passing the L1 altogether.
