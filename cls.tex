\chapter{The $\mathbf{\text{{\bf CL}}_s}$ method}

In the absence of an excess compatible with a signal hypothesis, we define 95\% confidence level (CL) exclusion limits on model parameters such as cross sections and particle masses.
The method used here was first used for the combination of CMS and ATLAS results for the Higgs search~\cite{cls1} and is based on earlier approaches from many other particle physics experiments~\cite{cls2,cls3}.
We define the test statistic as:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde q_\mu = -2\ln \frac{\La(\bm{d} ~|~ \mu,\hat{\bm{\theta}}_\mu)}{\La(\bm{d} ~|~ \hat\mu,\bm{\theta})}
\end{equation}
